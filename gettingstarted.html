        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>There are a couple of things you must first do in order to code for FTC: </p>
        <h2>1. Install Android Studio</h2>
        <p>FTC Code is built in Android Studio and then sent to a device called a Control Hub (subject to change), which can be purchased by REV Robotics at their website.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you will need a device called a Driver Station, which can be any android device, or you can buy one from Rev Robotics at their website. The driver station is the device that you will interact with during your game.</p>
        <p>Download and Follow the Installation Steps</p>
        <p><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">https://developer.android.com/studio</a></p>
        <h2>2. Install the FtcRobotController Repository into Android Studio</h2>
        <p>Once you have Android Studio installed, download the FtcRobotController repository</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController">https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController</a></p>
        <p>After download the zip file from github, extract it and open the main folder in Android Studio</p>
        <p>After opening it, open the TeamCode folder, the java folder, then the org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode folder. In it, you should only see a readme.md file</p>
        <p>Congratulations! You're officially ready to start coding FTC! If you decide to keep following along, I'll see you all soon! If not, I wish you the best of luck coding, and have fun!</p>
